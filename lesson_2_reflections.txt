How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	Case 1: finding places of breakage
	Case 2: Finding specific changes


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	If current version of the code dese not work I can get back to working verion in git


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
